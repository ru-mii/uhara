# Reasoning for versions
Compatible changes = cannot break and cause compatibility issues to ANY of the existing asl scripts

This template will apply when current version reaches 3, until then treat them all as beta with new features.   
Let's say the current version is uhara3, updates would work as follows:

current (3) [edge]
* new incompatible features
* incompatible code logic changes
* incompatible bug fixes

previous (2) [beta]
* no new features
* no code logic changes
* incompatible bug fixes

two before (1) [stable]
* no new features
* no code logic changes
* compatible bug fixes

Older versions would have no changes at all.
